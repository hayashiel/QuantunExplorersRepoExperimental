Quantum Computing
By: hayashiel

Quantum Computer, how small must that computer be?
To exist and not exist, such is the impossibility
Entangled in a web of uncertain probabilities
Here nor there, such the futility

Where neither up nor down, both are fair
In this world where Bell’s ain’t fair
Surface codes jamming square
Entanglement betwixt an electron pair

Where teleportation exists, but Star Trek doesn’t
Data exists, but cloning mustn’t
Tunneling through the real world, it doesn’t
Linked only by projective measurement

Spinning around with QFTs
QPE and similes
Though nothing has washed yet a Shor
RSA is sure to go poor

Quantum Systems are quite simple
Learning qubits(well in principle)
Such the probability
Impossibilities
Developing the future by sparking the kindle
